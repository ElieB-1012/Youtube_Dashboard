# Youtube_Dashboard

In this project, I am analyzing a YouTube channel where we compare the video statistics of the last 6 months with the average of the previous 12 months. Additionally, we study the viewers' characteristics (whether they are channel subscribers, their countries of origin, and the number of views per country). All of this is done to identify the success factors of the videos.
